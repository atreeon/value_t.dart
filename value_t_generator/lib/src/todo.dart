main() {
/*
TODO:
* allow defaults & optional
  if it is optional it must have a default value otherwise the value
  could be null which we definitely don't want.
  This seems like it could be difficult because I need to reach into the
  code and find my param and extract the fn attached to it
* change the destination of “go to definition” so it goes to $ClassName
* if a getter is redefined further down the hierarchy (overriden) make
  sure that the default value is overridden too
