TODO:
* think of a way to remove the need to define a constant constructor in the base type
* impose a rule that all levels of the superclass hierarchy must have a constant constructor
* add testing toString method
* add structural equality
* change the destination of “go to definition” so it goes to $ClassName
* if a getter is redefined further down the hierarchy (overriden) make
  sure that the default value is overridden too
* revert the old constructor syntax, not the named parameters but (sdf,sdf), much more readable
