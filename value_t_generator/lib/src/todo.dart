/*
TODO:
* think of a way to remove the need to define a constant constructor in the base type
* impose a rule that all levels of the superclass hierarchy must have a constant constructor
* add structural equality
* change the destination of “go to definition” so it goes to $ClassName
* if a getter is redefined further down the hierarchy (overriden) make
  sure that the default value is overridden too
* have two constructors, one named and one not named
    possibly for this, if the constructor list is <= 4 then have
    not named; or only have named for base types (string, int, bool etc)
    because objects usually define what the named type is quite well
    or some combination of that logic.  Named parameters are a bit verbose
    and often not necessary (can always name my variables a bit better
    if I want additional clarity)
