* impose a rule that all levels of the superclass hierarchy must have a constant constructor
* add structural equality
* change the destination of “go to definition” so it goes to $ClassName
* if a getter is redefined further down the hierarchy (overriden) make
  sure that the default value is overridden too
* have two constructors, one named and one not named
