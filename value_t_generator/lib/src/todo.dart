TODO:
* defining a function in a supertype's function doesn't propogate that to the subtypes
    this is because we use implements instead of extends when inheriting
* think of a way to remove the need to define a constant constructor in the base type
* impose a rule that all levels of the superclass hierarchy must have a constant constructor
* add structural equality
* change the destination of “go to definition” so it goes to $ClassName
* copy the comments
